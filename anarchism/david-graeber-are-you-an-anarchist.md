# Are You An Anarchist? The Answer May Surprise You!

*David Graeber*

Chances are you have already heard something about who anarchists are and what
they are supposed to believe. Chances are almost everything you have heard is
nonsense. Many people seem to think that anarchists are proponents of violence,
chaos, and destruction, that they are against all forms of order and
organization, or that they are crazed nihilists who just want to blow everything
up. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. Anarchists are simply
people who believe human beings are capable of behaving in a reasonable fashion
without having to be forced to. It is really a very simple notion. But it’s one
that the rich and powerful have always found extremely dangerous.

At their very simplest, anarchist beliefs turn on to two elementary
assumptions. The first is that human beings are, under ordinary circumstances,
about as reasonable and decent as they are allowed to be, and can organize
themselves and their communities without needing to be told how. The second is
that power corrupts. Most of all, anarchism is just a matter of having the
courage to take the simple principles of common decency that we all live by, and
to follow them through to their logical conclusions. Odd though this may seem,
in most important ways you are probably already an anarchist — you just don’t
realize it.

Let’s start by taking a few examples from everyday life.

If you answered “yes”, then you are used to acting like an anarchist! The most
basic anarchist principle is self-organization: the assumption that human beings
do not need to be threatened with prosecution in order to be able to come to
reasonable understandings with each other, or to treat each other with dignity
and respect.

Everyone believes they are capable of behaving reasonably themselves. If they
think laws and police are necessary, it is only because they don’t believe that
other people are. But if you think about it, don’t those people all feel exactly
the same way about you? Anarchists argue that almost all the anti-social
behavior which makes us think it’s necessary to have armies, police, prisons,
and governments to control our lives, is actually caused by the systematic
inequalities and injustice those armies, police, prisons and governments make
possible. It’s all a vicious circle. If people are used to being treated like
their opinions do not matter, they are likely to become angry and cynical, even
violent — which of course makes it easy for those in power to say that their
opinions do not matter. Once they understand that their opinions really do
matter just as much as anyone else’s, they tend to become remarkably
understanding. To cut a long story short: anarchists believe that for the most
part it is power itself, and the effects of power, that make people stupid and
irresponsible.

If you answered “yes”, then you belong to an organization which works on
anarchist principles! Another basic anarchist principle is voluntary
association. This is simply a matter of applying democratic principles to
ordinary life. The only difference is that anarchists believe it should be
possible to have a society in which everything could be organized along these
lines, all groups based on the free consent of their members, and therefore,
that all top-down, military styles of organization like armies or bureaucracies
or large corporations, based on chains of command, would no longer be
necessary. Perhaps you don’t believe that would be possible. Perhaps you do. But
every time you reach an agreement by consensus, rather than threats, every time
you make a voluntary arrangement with another person, come to an understanding,
or reach a compromise by taking due consideration of the other person’s
particular situation or needs, you are being an anarchist — even if you don’t
realize it.

Anarchism is just the way people act when they are free to do as they choose,
and when they deal with others who are equally free — and therefore aware of the
responsibility to others that entails. This leads to another crucial point: that
while people can be reasonable and considerate when they are dealing with
equals, human nature is such that they cannot be trusted to do so when given
power over others. Give someone such power, they will almost invariably abuse it
in some way or another.

If you answered “yes”, then you subscribe to the anarchist critique of today’s
society — at least, in its broadest outlines. Anarchists believe that power
corrupts and those who spend their entire lives seeking power are the very last
people who should have it. Anarchists believe that our present economic system
is more likely to reward people for selfish and unscrupulous behavior than for
being decent, caring human beings. Most people feel that way. The only
difference is that most people don’t think there’s anything that can be done
about it, or anyway — and this is what the faithful servants of the powerful are
always most likely to insist — anything that won’t end up making things even
worse.

But what if that weren’t true?

And is there really any reason to believe this? When you can actually test them,
most of the usual predictions about what would happen without states or
capitalism turn out to be entirely untrue. For thousands of years people lived
without governments. In many parts of the world people live outside of the
control of governments today. They do not all kill each other. Mostly they just
get on about their lives the same as anyone else would. Of course, in a complex,
urban, technological society all this would be more complicated: but technology
can also make all these problems a lot easier to solve. In fact, we have not
even begun to think about what our lives could be like if technology were really
marshaled to fit human needs. How many hours would we really need to work in
order to maintain a functional society — that is, if we got rid of all the
useless or destructive occupations like telemarketers, lawyers, prison guards,
financial analysts, public relations experts, bureaucrats and politicians, and
turn our best scientific minds away from working on space weaponry or stock
market systems to mechanizing away dangerous or annoying tasks like coal mining
or cleaning the bathroom, and distribute the remaining work among everyone
equally? Five hours a day? Four? Three? Two? Nobody knows because no one is even
asking this kind of question. Anarchists think these are the very questions we
should be asking.

> Do you really believe those things you tell your children (or that your
> parents told you)?

“It doesn’t matter who started it.” “Two wrongs don’t make a right.” “Clean up
your own mess.” “Do unto others...” “Don’t be mean to people just because
they’re different.” Perhaps we should decide whether we’re lying to our children
when we tell them about right and wrong, or whether we’re willing to take our
own injunctions seriously. Because if you take these moral principles to their
logical conclusions, you arrive at anarchism.


Take the principle that two wrongs don’t make a right. If you really took it
seriously, that alone would knock away almost the entire basis for war and the
criminal justice system. The same goes for sharing: we’re always telling
children that they have to learn to share, to be considerate of each other’s
needs, to help each other; then we go off into the real world where we assume
that everyone is naturally selfish and competitive. But an anarchist would point
out: in fact, what we say to our children is right. Pretty much every great
worthwhile achievement in human history, every discovery or accomplishment
that’s improved our lives, has been based on cooperation and mutual aid; even
now, most of us spend more of our money on our friends and families than on
ourselves; while likely as not there will always be competitive people in the
world, there’s no reason why society has to be based on encouraging such
behavior, let alone making people compete over the basic necessities of
life. That only serves the interests of people in power, who want us to live in
fear of one another. That’s why anarchists call for a society based not only on
free association but mutual aid. The fact is that most children grow up
believing in anarchist morality, and then gradually have to realize that the
adult world doesn’t really work that way. That’s why so many become rebellious,
or alienated, even suicidal as adolescents, and finally, resigned and bitter as
adults; their only solace, often, being the ability to raise children of their
own and pretend to them that the world is fair. But what if we really could
start to build a world which really was at least founded on principles of
justice? Wouldn’t that be the greatest gift to one’s children one could possibly
give?

If you answered “yes”, then, well, it looks like you aren’t an anarchist after
all. But if you answered “no”, then chances are you already subscribe to 90% of
anarchist principles, and, likely as not, are living your life largely in accord
with them. Every time you treat another human with consideration and respect,
you are being an anarchist. Every time you work out your differences with others
by coming to reasonable compromise, listening to what everyone has to say rather
than letting one person decide for everyone else, you are being an
anarchist. Every time you have the opportunity to force someone to do something,
but decide to appeal to their sense of reason or justice instead, you are being
an anarchist. The same goes for every time you share something with a friend, or
decide who is going to do the dishes, or do anything at all with an eye to
fairness.

Now, you might object that all this is well and good as a way for small groups
of people to get on with each other, but managing a city, or a country, is an
entirely different matter. And of course there is something to this. Even if you
decentralize society and put as much power as possible in the hands of small
communities, there will still be plenty of things that need to be coordinated,
from running railroads to deciding on directions for medical research. But just
because something is complicated does not mean there is no way to do it
democratically. It would just be complicated. In fact, anarchists have all sorts
of different ideas and visions about how a complex society might manage
itself. To explain them though would go far beyond the scope of a little
introductory text like this. Suffice it to say, first of all, that a lot of
people have spent a lot of time coming up with models for how a really
democratic, healthy society might work; but second, and just as importantly, no
anarchist claims to have a perfect blueprint. The last thing we want is to
impose prefab models on society anyway. The truth is we probably can’t even
imagine half the problems that will come up when we try to create a democratic
society; still, we’re confident that, human ingenuity being what it is, such
problems can always be solved, so long as it is in the spirit of our basic
principles — which are, in the final analysis, simply the principles of
fundamental human decency.
