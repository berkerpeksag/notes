# Indifferent Suns

*Haven (2000)*

And although it can be argued  
Whether time will ever come to end  
There is an overcoming sense of failing  
If you never can see the end  
In the giving of our hope eternal  
We stumble blindly and forget the way  
Is there ever time for answers  
When the world comes tumbling down  

**All along we keep staring at the sun**  
**Closing our minds**  
**Saying we´re the ones**  
**All along we keep staring at the sun**  
**Blind to see it when the day will come**  

And even if in days of wonders  

A glance that may stray from the fold  
Cast aside in the spirit of ignorance  
A mere nuisance when it´s time to pay  
Come undone now the strive and the passion  
Giving under to the forces that be  
Can you even think of questions  
When the world comes tumbling down  
We shut our eyes and turn away  

All along we keep staring at the sun  
Closing our minds  
Saying we´re the ones  
All along we keep staring at the sun  
Blind to see it when the day will come
