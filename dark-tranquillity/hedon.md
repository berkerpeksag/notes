# Hedon

*The Mind's I*

Enter suicidal angels;  

How hungry we've become;  
like animals naked in shame  
Fed with the tongues of apocalypse  
that galloped down disordered worlds behind  

From word to a word I was led to a word  
that spanned over cultures in rage  
Crimson masses, steeped in decadence  
holding our tongues to the thirsty sun  
So, is the future still open?  
(so tell me, tell me)  
Then enter, hornet, from our hive-dark hearts  
And draw down the end from within  

We need not the horns  
That emanate from our dying, haunted bodies  
severed and numbered they are  

Nihilist, Hedon  
the priceless art of their lives  
Sorrow is a wing laid atop their heads.  
skin deep, we carve our immeasurable sorrow  
in the fold of your shivering arms  

How hungry we've become  
Like animals naked in shame  
Fed with the hooves of apocalypse  
That galloped down disordered worlds behind  

Hedon,  
Your children wild  
and filled with death  

# Jupiter in our unforgiving eyes:  
a pandemonium of bodies and gold  
Eager, as a part of your face  
and the sickness attached to your skin (stone)  
As the wine rush,  
Charging from androgynous wombs  
to open free the lid of pain #  

Hedon,  
rinsed in post-human shadows  
a monument scorned by the teeth of time  
Stale-faced keeper of secrets,  
loaded with implosive fire  
the whore that carried the apostle  
to the mating point on the graves of giants  

We look at you,  
afraid to see what we really are.
